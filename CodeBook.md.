1.Libraries used in this project are
  1.1 tidyverse  1.2 tidyr   1.3 dplyr  1.4 stringr
 
2. Datasets obtained from assigment provided link are
  X_test 
  Y_test 
  X_train 
  Y_train 
  activity_labels 
  features
  subject_train
  subject_test
  "_test" mean loaded from from test folder.
  "_train" mean loaded from from train folder.
  
3. Y_trainlabel and Y_testlabel datasets are the products of merging descriptive activity name with no. of each activity.
    Descriptive activity name obtained from activity_labels dataset.
    1 = WALKING
    2 = WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    3 = WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    4 = SITTING
    5 = STANDING
    6 = LAYING

4.featuresmean and featuresSD are the vectors contain int. that represent each element in features dataset, which measurements on mean and S.D.

5.columns_of_interest is a vector which combine featuresmean with featuresSD . Represent all columns taht  measurements on mean and S.D.

6.X_train_interest and X_test_interest are datasets that subsetted X_train and X_test datasets to get only columns of interest (columns related to mean and S.D)

7.Train and Test datasets are obtained by merging 
  subject_train with Y_trainlabel and X_train_interest = Train
  subject_test  with Y_testlabel and X_test_interest = Test
 
8.Data dataset is obtained by merging Train with Test datasets from above.
9.Tidy_Data is an independent dataset which compute average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
